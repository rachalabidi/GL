        The “Software Engineering” license has six semesters, including :
        <br> 
        The first four semesters are semesters common to all degrees in the “IT” field.<br>
        The fifth and sixth semesters (S5 and S6) are specific semesters of the specialty.<br>
        
        The S5 semester focuses on theoretical and practical aspects related to software engineering. It includes lessons such as: software design, software development, advanced database techniques, software quality (tools and methods), advanced web technologies and software project management.<br>
        
        The objective of the semester (S6) is to put into practice the various courses (theoretical, technical, organisational and human aspects…) of the S5 on a large-scale IT project (in the form of a workshop lasting about 12 weeks). In conjunction with this project, other practical lessons are planned such as network administration.</p>
